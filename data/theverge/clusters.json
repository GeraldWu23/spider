    "Microsoft had originally planned to let Xbox One users share any games digitally, but a backlash over the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes\">used games policies and online check</a> forced the company to reverse most of its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4446356/back-to-reality-microsofts-new-xbox-one-policies-retreat-from-the-future\">promising plans</a>. Although disc-based games can no longer be converted into digitally shareable copies, Microsoft is outlining what can be shared this week, and it's very similar to how the Xbox 360 works today. The reversal of policies may have changed Microsoft's plans, but&nbsp;Xbox chief product officer Marc Whitten tells us that \"most people will use this platform connected,\" and the company still plans to bring back some of the original Xbox One features.",
    "Xbox One games purchased digitally can be used by all players in a household on an Xbox One. Just as discs can be played by any family member today, Microsoft will allow Xbox One owners to create a virtual game library that includes different games that family members have purchased digitally. Any family member will be able to pick a digital game and sign in with their account even if the original owner is not signed in. Xbox One owners will also be able to play digitally downloaded games without being online. Essentially, Xbox Live digital games are tied to your gamertag, but they're also tied to your primary console. Despite this, Microsoft is not commenting on when features like being able to resell digital games will become available, but Whitten says Xbox One's digital vision is&nbsp;\"going to drive a lot of different business models over time.\"",
    "Xbox One owners will be able to use a Microsoft Account as a type of digital passport to sign in and use games on another console. A key part of this sharing and cloud-powered Xbox Live is a new feature that Microsoft is calling Home Gold. Existing Xbox Live Gold members will be able to set up an Xbox One at home and anyone who uses the console will be able to access multiplayer gaming and the entertainment apps even if the main account holder is not signed in or at home. An Xbox One owner with an Xbox Live Gold subscription could also log in at a friend's house and everyone on that particular console would then be able to use multiplayer gaming and the entertainment apps while the Gold member is signed in. It sounds a little complicated, that's because it is, but in reality Microsoft is extending its Xbox Live Gold subscription so that you don't have to buy individual subscriptions for each family member.",
    "On the gaming side it means that friends can use an Xbox One owners' console and play online multiplayer with their own gamertag. Currently, a friend would also have to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold to play online with a gamertag, otherwise the friend gets the same gamertag with a number tagged on the end. Although Xbox One owners will be able to sign in on other consoles and access their digital games \u2014 and let friends play them too \u2014 it won't be like handing a friend an unprotected MP3 that they can play over and over again with no limits. Microsoft says existing Xbox Live Gold members won't have to do anything to access the new Home Gold features as they're available as part of the subscription for Xbox One and Xbox 360 consoles.",
    "Despite the changes not being very different to how things are today with the Xbox 360, Microsoft says it still wants to bring the improved digital sharing features,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4446356/back-to-reality-microsofts-new-xbox-one-policies-retreat-from-the-future\">that it has retreated from</a>, to the Xbox One in time. \"We are completely committed to the digital vision we laid out, and we plan and intend to deliver all the things we said before,\" Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi tells us. Mehdi explains that Microsoft wants to and \"can do it,\" but it's seeking feedback before any future changes are made. \"You're going to see more of the things that we talked about with digital,\" he confirms, including a Family Sharing feature that Microsoft previously revealed as an option to share digital content with family members regardless of console or location.&nbsp;Mehdi says Microsoft still has \"creative pricing models\" for games, and trial games on their list for post-launch. For now, Microsoft is clearly approaching any potential changes with caution to avoid a backlash over policy changes that have left consumers confused by its Xbox One launch so far.",
    "Long after Apple's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3254422/apple-samsung-trial-verdict/in/2971889\">victory over Samsung in a patent suit</a>, the two companies met again today in court as a panel of judges decides whether to issue a sales ban on over two dozen Samsung devices. These phones and tablets were found to use features and designs patented by Apple, but so far, that decision has only resulted in a major fine for Samsung \u2014 in December, Judge Lucy Koh found that damages were enough for Apple to recoup its losses, so an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/29/3931066/judge-rules-that-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patents-willfully/in/2971889\">out-and-out ban wasn't warranted</a>. Now, Apple has brought its case to the Federal Court of Appeals, which is set to make what could be a near-final call on the issue.",
    "Apple's requested ban doesn't mean much in the short term. Of the 26 phones and tablets it listed, 23 have been discontinued, and Samsung has worked to design around Apple's patents in the remaining three. Samsung, meanwhile, says the ban would have little impact on its design process. So why does this case matter on either side? For its part, Apple hopes that getting an injunction will make it easier to bring cases against newer products. Taking a quick dig at Samsung's design process, Apple attorney William Lee said that a new Samsung device might be almost identical to an old, banned one. \"What they're saying to you is 'the product with this name is off the market,\" he said.",
    "If it gets the ban, Apple would still need to bring more cases, but it could have an easier time in court. This would hurt Samsung, obviously, but it's not the company's only fear. Any injunction, it says, would hurt its relationship with retail stores and carriers, who would worry about whether they were accidentally selling an infringing product. Likewise, this could have a major impact on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329570/apple-galaxy-s4-infringement-samsung-patent-suit\">second ongoing <i>Apple vs. Samsung </i>case</a>, which should go to trial early next year. Though it decisively won the original case, Apple is on the defensive here. Koh decided Apple hadn't proved its patents were a driving factor in how customers chose phones. For Apple to get its injunction, it first has to convince the court that this bar was set far too high, then make a case for why it meets a different, lower standard.",
    "\"I don't think that anybody in Apple's position\" could absolutely prove a major link between a single feature or collection of features and sales, said Lee. Companies can be required to prove \"irreparable harm,\" but holding Apple to this standard would be a \"fundamental change in American patent law,\" he argued. But Samsung has steadily claimed that the patents in question weren't major factors when buying a phone. \"There's no proof of any infringement here being <em>a</em> driver, much less <em>the</em> driver, of consumer demand,\" said Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan. During the case, Apple presented a report showing how much customers would pay for the extra UI features Samsung copied \u2014 on phones, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3234453/apple-expert-smartphone-owners-100-premium-copied-samsung-trial\">an extra $100</a>.<q class=\"right\"></q>",
    "Sullivan questioned whether the survey itself was relevant, an argument that seemed to hold little water with the judges. She used the example of one car company copying another's cupholders: \"The fact that I'd pay $10 more for a car that I was going to buy anyways\" doesn't show that it's driving consumer demand, she said. \"It still doesn't tell you that the phone with the infringing feature will be chosen over the non-infringing product,\" she said. Judge William Bryson disagreed. \"It shows that consumers value that feature,\" he said. \"That seems to me to be the very essence of what a driver of demand is.\" He then moved the question from cupholders to something like a hybrid engine, which he said could be an important feature even if customers still decided on a cheaper, non-hybrid one.",
    "It wouldn't be too surprising to see Koh's earlier decision overturned \u2014 she and the appeals court have frequently disagreed on when to ban a product. Early in the case, the court decided she was wrong to let Samsung keep selling devices that arguably infringed on Apple's design. Later, though, it overturned her ban on the Galaxy Nexus, saying Apple hadn't proven its universal search was a major sales driver.",
    "In this case, the court won't be deciding whether to temporarily ban something before deciding whether it's infringing; it will be making a call after a jury overwhelmingly decided that Samsung did, in fact, copy Apple. And though Samsung's lawyer denied it, the judges repeatedly asked whether she was arguing against bans for entire broad classes of lawsuits, which would back up Apple's claim of a \"fundamental change\" in the law.",
    "Depending on how convincing the court finds Apple's argument, it could either completely uphold Koh's decision or throw it out \u2014 at which point either company could potentially appeal to the Supreme Court. Conversely, it could hand the issue back to Koh, giving her instructions to consider it further or issue specific injunctions. Closure has been slow in coming with this lawsuit, but today's hearing marked a step towards the end of at least one part of it.",
    "<small>\u00a9 Michael Nichols/National Geographic</small>",
    "Michael Nichols has spent the past two years living with lions in Tanzania. An award-winning photographer and editor, Nichols ventured into Africa's Serengeti Plain in July 2011 to document a pride of lions for a <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/lion-conservation/quammen-text\" target=\"_blank\">feature story</a> in this month's issue of <i>National Geographic</i>. The idea, according to the magazine, was to provide a more intimate glimpse into the daily lives of one of the world\u2019s most fearsome predators \u2014 and to photograph them like never before.",
    "\"You don't want to be looking down on animals. They hate it; it is demeaning to them,\" the photographer said in an <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130802-nick-nichols-lion-photos-infrared-drones-mikrokopter-lion-car/\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> with <i>National Geographic</i> earlier this month. \"I couldn't bear photographing lions looking down on them; it made me sick to my stomach.\"",
    "Yet capturing the lions from an up-close, ground level posed obvious risks, both to the safety of Nichols\u2019 team and the welfare of the Vumbi pride they were following. They could have easily photographed the lions from afar with standard telephoto lenses, but <i>National Geographic</i> had a <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/18/2645097/national-geographic-living-with-lions-micro-copter\">more innovative solution</a> in mind \u2014 one that involved aerial drones, robots, and infrared lights. And the results, published last week in an <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/serengeti-lions/nichols-photography\" target=\"_blank\">online gallery</a> and <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/serengeti-lion/index.html#.UgTQQWRgahg\" target=\"_blank\">interactive website</a>, are nothing short of astounding.",
    "<small><i>Images available at <a href=\"http://ngm.com/serengeti-lion\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Serengeti Lion\"</a> on </i>National Geographic<i>'s website.</i></small>",
    "After extensive trials and testing, Nichols and cinematographer Nathan Williamson sent a small, remote-controlled robot into the field to capture images from within inches of the lions. The camera-equipped \"mini-tank\" was manufactured by SuperDroid Robots, a North Carolina-based engineering company that specializes in bomb-defusing robotics. As the tank patrolled the ground, snapping the Vumbi pride from a bug\u2019s-eye view, a German-made MikroKopter drone took to the skies, capturing aerial shots with an \"off-the-shelf\" Canon camera. Nichols and Williamson, meanwhile, were stationed in a customized Land Rover parked nearby, capturing wide shots from the floor of the car, and controlling the robot and drone remotely.",
    "Because lions sleep during the day and hunt at night, the team was forced to do the majority of their work in darkness, illuminating the Tanzanian landscape with infrared lights mounted to the top of their Land Rover. The invisible infrared rays allowed <i>National Geographic</i> to capture scenes without disturbing the lions\u2019 regular habits, though the blind conditions involved plenty of trial-and-error.",
    "\"At one point, we were high-fiving, thinking we had captured a herd of zebra by moonrise from the micro-copter, only to find out later we had been photographing a pile of rocks,\" Williamson said in an email to <i>The Verge</i>. Nichols captured more than 240,000 shots over the course of the expedition, with Williams shooting an additional 200 hours of video footage.",
    "There was also concern over how the lions would react to the drone and robot, but according to Nichols, they adapted rather quickly. \"After only three visits they didn't care about that tank,\" he told the magazine. \"At first they were cautious... But after five or six times they were all falling asleep with it.\"",
    "Drones have played an increasingly large role in wildlife preservation and filmmaking in recent years. In 2011, a team of filmmakers used a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtu.be/UtUzaBpaSY0\">quadrotor drone</a> to capture scenes of the Serengeti for a TV documentary in Japan. Researchers in Kenya, meanwhile, have begun using unmanned aerial drones to monitor areas susceptible to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/30/world/africa/drone-poaching-ol-pejeta\">rhino poaching</a>.",
    "According to Nichols, the technology provided \"an opportunity to photograph animals on their terms,\" though it's unclear whether similar devices could be used to capture elephants, zebras, or other species. \"Lions are both confident and conservative in how they expend their energy,\" the photographer told <i>The Verge</i>. And although they were aware that the machines belonged to the green truck that had been following them, \"they never perceived the robot as a threat.\"",
    "<small><i>A lion named \"C-Boy\" mates with a Kibumbu pride female. \u00a9 Michael Nichols/National Geographic </i></small>",
    "For Nichols and <i>National Geographic</i>, this month's publication marks the culmination of more than five years of research and planning. Yet as remarkable as the imagery is, the project extends well beyond the realm of the visual. With worldwide lion populations declining at <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats/lion-decline-map/\" target=\"_blank\">alarming rates</a>, <i>National Geographic</i> sought not only to provide an unfiltered glimpse into the Vumbi pride's social hierarchy and behavior, but to prove that man and beast can peacefully coexist, as well.",
    "\"This is more than a wildlife behavior story, this is a conservation story,\" says Kathy Moran, senior photo editor at <i>National Geographic</i>. \"Our goal was to dispel myths about lions, to show how lions live and what it means for people to live with lions.\"",
    "If we had the technology to rewire our brains to help remember certain things and forget others, it could help millions of people struggling with neurological conditions, from Alzheimer\u2019s to post-traumatic stress disorder. But it also raises the frightening possibility \u2014 depicted over and over again in sci-fi \u2014 that someone would be able to use such technology to mess with people\u2019s minds without their consent.",
    "For good or ill, such techniques are edging closer to reality. In the last few months, several teams of scientists have made enormous leaps in visualizing memories and manipulating them. The work is confined to animals for now, but helping adjust the functioning of the human brain is the ultimate goal, raising the questions: just how far can and should we go?",
    "In June a team of scientists led by researchers at the University of Southern California <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791193\">published a paper</a> explaining that they had figured out a way to watch memories form in the brains of mice and zebrafish in real-time. The paper was largely overlooked by the mainstream press at the time, but its implications for the future of neurobiology are enormous. \"This provides a much clearer window [into the brain] than anyone\u2019s ever had before; it\u2019s hard to predict where this will go from here\" says Donald Arnold, an associate professor of molecular and computational biology at the University of Southern California who led the team. Using this technique \"it should be possible to use this to delete and modify memory in some way,\" he explains.",
    "<img src=\"http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/3032177/brain-tracker-neuron-synapses-red-green-socal.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Brain-tracker-neuron-synapses-red-green-socal\"><br id=\"1376065235272\"><small><i>Microscopic image of a neuron in the brain of a living mouse, showing synapses lit up with fluorescent probes. (Credit: Donald Arnold/University of Southern California)</i></small>",
    "Prior to the work by Arnold and his colleagues, scientists weren\u2019t exactly sure how memories were encoded in the brain. The basic consensus was that whenever you experience something, your memory is stored in <a href=\"http://courses.washington.edu/psych333/handouts/coursepack/ch04-Neuron_structure_and_cell_biology.pdf\">neurons</a> \u2014 specialized, tree branch-like nerve cells that number in the tens of billions in a single human brain, and which carry information in the form of electrical signals.",
    "Neurons communicate with one another across gaps known as synapses. When an electrical signal carrying information, say a memory, reaches the end of a neuron, it triggers the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter, which then floats across the synapse and lands on the receiving end of another neuron. Think of pollen floating from one tree to another. If all goes correctly, the receiving neuron picks up the neurotransmitter and fires its own electrical signal, which may cause it to release a neurotransmitter to yet another neuron. It\u2019s this passage of information between neurons that lets your brain function. The vividness of a particular memory is thought to be related to the strength of synapses, that is, how reliably the neuron fires when it picks up a neurotransmitter. But scientists haven\u2019t been able to see this process of memory encoding in action \u2014 until now.",
    "What Arnold and his colleagues did was create a protein that sticks to the portion of a neuron responsible for absorbing the neurotransmitter, called the receptor. Then, they took a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish and stuck that onto the other end of their protein. When they implanted their glowing proteins into mice and zebrafish brains, they were able to look through a fluorescence microscope and watch as their proteins collected around the receptors.",
    "<small><i>Microscopic image of the dendrite, or electrically conductive branchlike ends of a neuron in a mouse, with glowing proteins showing synaptic strength (Credit: Donald Arnold, University of Southern California).</i></small>",
    "\"This allows us not only to see where synapses are, but how strong they are, by how bright and big these dots are,\" Arnold tells&nbsp;<em>The Verge.</em> \"We can see new synapses forming and old synapses disappearing, and changes in synaptic strength.\" Arnold says that his team\u2019s next work would involve teaching zebrafish and mice particular tasks and watching to see how their synapses change.",
    "\"Ultimately, the experiment we envision is looking at a mouse, having the mouse learn something, seeing how the synapses change, then going back in there and modifying the synapses to see if you can get rid of the memory,\" Arnold says. Deleting a memory using this technique would involve simply sticking a natural protein made in the brain on to the same protein made by researchers, which carries the glowing material. \"It\u2019s like a guided missile, you can put whatever payload you want on it.\" Arnold says. But, as he says, deleting memories in people using this method \"seems way far off to me.\" Instead, he says, \"it would be easier to screen for drugs that would help you forget.\"",
    "Already, his team has begun work on arming the proteins they\u2019ve made to help delete some other proteins, such as those that build up in the brains of those suffering neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",
    "\"It\u2019s known that the vast majority of proteins in the brain turn over every week or faster.\" Arnold says. \"A week from now, your brain is essentially built from entirely new proteins. Nobody knows how that happens and your memories are retained. It\u2019s crazy.\" But in neurodegenerative diseases, certain proteins that would ordinarily disappear linger and build up in brain cells, causing memory problems. \"A bit of this trash doesn\u2019t seem to get picked up, it just builds and builds,\" Arnold explains. \"Can you get rid of the junk that builds up? Why does it build up? We want to at least start to answer these questions.\"",
    "Other scientists are taking a different approaching to understanding how the brain stores and transmits information, coming at it from other body parts connected to an animal\u2019s nervous system. For instance, a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Germany reported earlier this week that they\u2019d successfully <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/making-connections-in-the-eye-0807.html\">\"mapped\" 950 neurons</a> in a slice of retina from a dead mouse\u2019s eye. This technique could have applications for restoring sight and, if applied to the brain, for manipulating memory.",

    "\"We can imagine that our wiring diagram of the retina can help scientists down the road design and target retinal prosthetics to the right neurons,\" says Srinivas Turaga, one of the MIT scientists involved, in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. \"And like you suggest with memory manipulation, having a circuit diagram will tell us which neurons to manipulate and how.\"",
    "Turaga and his colleagues created their map of the mouse retina by using an electron microscope to take 3D images of the slice of retina, then having no less than 225 undergraduate students look at the images and physically trace the wiring connecting them by hand, which took a collective 20,000 hours.",
    "He tells&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em> that his German colleagues were working on additional microscopic technology that would be able to image larger slices, and that \"we hope that this will eventually allow us to scan a mouse brain in about a year.\" Turuga says that tracing all those neurons could take up to another 5 to 10 years total. Still, when the researchers achieve that goal, they also hope to use their advances to help treat those suffering from neurological diseases.",
    "\"Having this wiring diagram (or connectome) will allow us to better understand what a normal neural circuit looks like and to detect and shed light on abnormalities in the circuitry associated with neurological disorders,\" Turaga says. \"Once we can better understand such circuit abnormalities (or connectopathies), we can develop targeted methods of treatment.\"",
    "Although some groups of scientists are getting closer to figuring out just how the brain works to store information, others have already begun tinkering with memories. Last week, a team of scientists led by a different group at MIT made headlines around the world for their success at <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/25/4557200/MIT-researchers-implant-false-memories-in-mice\">implanting a \"false\" memory into mouse subjects</a>, getting the mice to think that they had been painfully shocked in one location, when in reality, they\u2019d been shocked in an entirely different one. The scientists achieved this by stimulating specific neurons in one area of the mouse brains.",

    "One of the scientists involved in that MIT project, neurobiologist Steve Ramirez, later told <em><a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/disruptions-rather-than-time-computers-might-become-panacea-to-hurt/\">The New York Times</a></em> that he thought it would soon be possible to use similar techniques to delete specific parts of memories. Rather than wiping out the whole memory of a relationship and an ex-girlfriend as in the 2004 sci-fi / romantic comedy movie <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,</em> Ramirez says \"we can get rid of the sad part of that memory,\" only.",
    "Indeed, humans have fantasized about being able to reprogram our minds at will since the early days of written history. In ancient Greek mythology, the souls of the dead were supposed to drink from a <a href=\"http://www.helium.com/items/1491770-greek-mythology-lethe\">river of forgetfulness</a> in the underworld in order to forget their lives and be reincarnated. Aside from <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, many other stories and movies have tackled the subject of memory manipulation, from <em>Total Recall</em> to <em>Inception</em> to <em>Dark City.</em> But some scientists think that even given all these recent advances, humans won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t ever get to the point where the scenarios described in sci-fi are possible.",
    "\"Those memory-altering techniques are invasive, using either genetic engineering or virus methods to manipulate genes in the mouse brain,\" comments Joe Tsien, a neurology professor who serves as co-director of Georgia Regents University\u2019s Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute. Tsien would know, given that back in 2008, he and his colleagues successfully <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/23/us-memory-erase-idUSTRE49M8EY20081023\">deleted specific memories</a> in mice by targeting yet another type of brain protein.",
    "Going forward, Tsien says, \"It is unlikely these experimental techniques in mice can be directly transferred for use in wiping a human person's memories.\" He points out that memories of upsetting or traumatic events are actually crucial to our evolution, teaching us resilience and to avoid certain situations or behaviors that may lead to hardship. Removing them might make a person feel better, but would also doom them to repeat their mistakes. \"Memories, whether good or bad, serve an adaptive purpose,\" Tsien says.",

    "On Thursday, Elon Musk and Richard Branson sat down for a Hangout video chat with Google for Entrepreneurs to talk about the struggles and satisfaction of starting a business. The hourlong talk, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtu.be/Vy9y_YSpYxA\">which can be seen in full on YouTube</a>, covered a broad range of topics, such as why Silicon Valley attracts talent, and the danger of \"burning out\" by not delegating enough responsibility to others. Musk even hyped up the Hyperloop \u2014 a proposed train system that could travel from <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4534476/how-will-elon-musks-hyperloop-work\">Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes</a>, and that <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/8/4602644/elon-musk-has-no-plans-to-actually-build-his-hyperloop-design\">Musk won't be building himself</a> \u2014 stating that he'd share \"the full details\" of his idea on Monday.",
    "One thing Musk was willing to share today was the fact that the two companies he's currently running, Tesla and Space X, both almost went bankrupt in 2008 due to failed rocket launches and a US financial crisis that later grew into a recession. Branson, who is the chairman of the 400-company Virgin Group, said \"I knew Elon in those days and I'm surprised his hair is still black and not grey.\" Later, he added that \"there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And all that matters when you're building a company is survival.\" A key tip the two shared for any entrepreneurs: listen and look for advice. \"You should seek negative feedback, particularly from friends,\" Musk said. \"Friends don't want to tell you exactly what's wrong, because they don't want to hurt your feelings, but they often know.\"",

    "This has been a really wacko-cool experience that people are like, \"Hey what the hell is this book?\" Usually that\u2019s expressed as some complicated emoji-sentence, often combining the triangular poop icon with that weird one of someone in the bathtub and sometimes the gun.",
    "So, I think that it matters very much to me, and it matters to librarians, and it might matter to the people <em>in</em> the book, who are all very real and delightful \u2026 but it won\u2019t matter at all to most readers.

    "For the certain kind of reader who does care, I am here to verify that the book is 100 percent true. Every person, every fact, every piece of dialogue: all of it.

This is true, but it really <em>was</em> for a brief time, and it was only as near as anyone could calculate. It\u2019s hard to figure out who\u2019s richer than whom.

But: I firmly believe that anyone who wants to can and should do it. You could be done with a book before Christmas! It\u2019s actually <em>not</em> brain surgery, because no one really agrees what a good book is, so maybe, even though you have no idea what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s possible everyone will be like, \"Hey, this is awesome.\"",
    "I mean, I didn\u2019t go to college, I barely graduated high school, and no one taught me how to write properly, and then a Rupert Murdoch company gave me a decent pile of money to write a book and actually published it, even though it was clearly a piece of craziness.

Our intelligence is focused above all on finding the information that's necessary to protect our people, and in many cases, protect our allies.\"",

    "Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world's 19th-richest man, has acquired <i>The</i><em> Washington Post</em>, long one of the country's most influential and prestigious daily newspapers, for $250 million in cash, the company announced today. \"The purchaser is an entity that belongs to Mr. Bezos in his individual capacity and is not Amazon.com, Inc.,\" a press release issued by <i>The Washington Post</i> said. The purchase includes all of the papers <i>The Washington Post </i>owns (and their websites), including the <i>Express</i> daily, <i>The Gazette</i> Newspapers, and the Southern Maryland Newspapers, but does not include <i>Slate</i>, <i>TheRoot.com</i> or <i>Foreign Policy</i>, which will remain with the Washington Post Company.",
    "Last week, Bezos sold about $185 million worth of Amazon shares, though it's unclear whether the sale is connected to the acquisition.",
    "By acquiring a cornerstone of Washington DC media, Bezos had immediately become a player in the nation's capital and expands his already significant profile in the media world. Founded 136 years ago, the<em> Post</em> is best known for its reporting on the Watergate scandal, which led to the resignation of US President Richard Nixon in 1974. That story elevated the publication from a well-respected regional daily paper to an internationally recognized news organization.",
    "At first glance, the deal looks like a natural extension of Amazon's media strategy. Much has been made of Bezos' and Amazon's increasing desire to become major media producers. In recent years, Amazon has become an ebook publisher and enabled authors to self publish. The company created a film studio to supply Amazon Instant Video with original TV shows and movies. But speculation over what Amazon may have planned for a general newspaper should be tempered by the fact that the acquisition was not made by Amazon, but by Bezos personally.",
    "In a <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/5/4591824/jeff-bezos-memo-to-washington-post-staff-i-already-have-a-day-job\">memo to the staff</a> of the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bezos praised the previous owners, saying, \"I would highlight two kinds of courage the Grahams have shown as owners that I hope to channel. The first is the courage to say wait, be sure, slow down, get another source. Real people and their reputations, livelihoods and families are at stake. The second is the courage to say follow the story, no matter the cost.\" He also added, \"I won't be leading <i>The Washington Post</i> day-to-day. I am happily living in 'the other Washington' where I have a day job that I love. Besides that, the<i> Post </i>already has an excellent leadership team that knows much more about the news business than I do, and I'm extremely grateful to them for agreeing to stay on.\"",
    "Bezos is taking over the <em>Post</em> during a dark period for the publication and for newspapers in general. The <em>Post</em> has hemorrhaged readers and revenue for many years. Last week, the Washington Post Company reported an operating loss of $49.3 million in the first six months of 2013, compared to a $33.2 million loss for the same period a year earlier, a 14 percent decline.",
    "<em>The New York Times</em> announced last weekend that it had sold <em>The Boston Globe</em> for $70 million in cash. The <em>Times</em>, which paid $1.1 billion 20 years ago for the daily newspaper, had hoped to get $100 million.",
    "The past decade has been a period of painful belt-tightening at the <em>Post</em> that included the closing of overseas news bureaus, a general scaling back of coverage, and numerous rounds of employee buyouts. The paper was at one time regarded as a peer of The<em> New York Times</em> and The<em> Wall Street Journal</em>. In the mid-1990s, the <em> Post's</em> weekday circulation topped 750,000 readers but has since fallen to 474,000. In addition, the newspaper has struggled to maintain its status as the go-to outlet for national politics against scrappy blogs and news organizations with far less overhead, such as <em>Politico</em> and The <em>Huffington Post</em>. In the past two years, the <em> Post's</em> uncertain future has led to an exodus of many of its top writers.",
    "According to Forbes, Bezos has a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/%20net%20worth\" target=\"new\">personal net worth of $25 billion</a>.

In April, Bezos Expeditions led a $5 million round of funding into online news blog <em>Business Insider</em>. Thus far, those investments have played little if any role in forwarding Amazon's agenda.  Then, what does this second investment in a news organization mean? Does Bezos want to be Rupert Murdoch?",
    "When that investment was announced, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-05/here-s-why-amazon-s-jeff-bezos-invested-in-business-insider\" target=\"new\">Bezos told Brad Stone of <i>Businessweek</i></a> that he saw an opportunity in how technology is streamlining news distribution and cutting out middlemen. Even \u201cwell-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,\u201d Bezos told the magazine. According to Stone, Bezos is a fan of email newsletters that are \"short, well written, and are delivered right to readers via email with minimal fuss and no expense.\"",
    "It's hard to conceive of someone repackaging the<i> Post</i> into an outlet for bite-size news stories. The newspaper has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes and the brand is associated with long-form investigative journalism. But shorter stories is the direction print journalism has been headed for years, and there's no denying the <i>Post</i> is a much more diminished version of itself than the one immortalized in the Robert Redford film <em>All The President's Men</em>.",
    "Still, the acquisition of the <i>Post </i>should give Bezos greater access to power. The paper was purchased in 1933 by Eugene Meyer and it's been in his family ever since. Under the leadership of Katharine Graham, Meyer's daughter, the paper had a part in publishing the Pentagon Papers, and it was her decision to back Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting on Watergate. She became the doyenne of Washington's social scene and the paper allowed her to cultivate friendships with Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Ronald Reagan.",
    "After Katharine Graham died in 2001, the company was turned over to Donald Graham, one of her sons. In 2008, his niece Katharine Weymouth, 47, was made publisher.

Last year, the CEO and his wife donated $2.5 million to a group trying to get a same-sex marriage law passed in Washington. And interestingly enough, Amazon scored a coup last week when <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4572222/president-obama-to-sit-for-kindle-singles-interview\">President Barack Obama </a>agreed to give a speech at one of the company's warehouses.",
    "As for Amazon, the retailer is plenty concerned with several political issues, key among them the debate over <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4304764/senate-passes-marketplace-fairness-act-online-sales-tax-bill\">taxing online retailers</a>. Then, there was the ebook scandal. Many suspect that Amazon spurred the government to investigate five of the top six book publishers as well as Apple for scheming to raise and fix ebook prices, a move that forced Amazon to stop discounting ebooks. The feds sued and the publishers <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/2/4582068/doj-wants-apple-to-terminate-ebook-deals-compete-on-price\">paid a $160 million settlement</a>. Apple fought in court but last month was <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/10/4510338/apple-found-guilty-of-ebook-price-fixing/in/4156915\">found liable</a> for antitrust violations.",
    "So sure, Bezos is now the owner of the<em> Post</em>, and not Amazon. But having a CEO who's a big shot in Washington certainly won't hurt."
