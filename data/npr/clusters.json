    "Heading into Friday's news conference, President Obama had a delicate balancing act before him: how to acknowledge widespread concerns about National Security Agency surveillance without in any way legitimizing the actions of leaker Edward Snowden.",
    "The best course, the president decided, was to acknowledge that Snowden's revelations to some degree forced his administration to accelerate and expand a review of the federal government's surveillance activities.",
    "But Obama wanted to make clear that he, not some random event, set in motion the administration's policy review — even before details of the NSA data gathering involving phone records and Internet communications became public.",
    "The president sought to rip off the hero's mantle some have placed on Snowden after his leaks began appearing in the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper: \"I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. ... The fact is, is that Mr. Snowden's been charged with three felonies.\"",
    "It also was a fact, however, and Obama spoke to it, that Snowden's disclosures did push the administration in ways it would have avoided if it could have.",
    "\"There's no doubt that Mr. Snowden's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through — and I'd sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through.\"",
    "The president reminded his audience of his May speech when he addressed the use of drones and targeted killings in U.S. counterterrorism efforts.",
    "It was then, before Snowden became a household name, that the president told the nation he had ordered a broad examination of the government surveillance.",
    "But Obama's May message — the essence of which was \"we've got this\" — and the assurances since then clearly haven't tamped down enough of the fears or criticisms. Americans have become significantly less trusting of government assurances on civil liberties the more 9/11 recedes into the background.",
    "A recent Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/few-see-adequate-limits-on-nsa-surveillance-program/\">survey</a> found half of Americans approving government anti-terrorism programs that collect telephone and Internet data, with 44 percent disapproving.",
    "But for the first time since Pew Research began tracking it in 2004, Americans expressed more concern about restrictions of civil liberties going too far than protection from terrorism.",
    "And in a remarkable change since 2006, Pew found the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans — 38 percent — who agreed that the government's policies didn't go far enough to protect Americans. There was a 9-percentage point difference in 2006.",
    "Part of what we seemed to be witnessing with Obama was the education of a president, and the difference between having the ultimate responsibility of protecting the nation and being a legislator in the policymaking process.",
    "As Obama himself acknowledged again Friday, when he was a senator during the Bush administration, he thought somewhat differently.",
    "\"Now, keep in mind that as a senator, I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs,\" he said. He gave the strong impression that knowing what he now knows from sitting in the Oval Office, his inclinations run in a different direction.",
    "Still, he understood that though he may have thought the existing checks and balances were enough to assure Americans, he now realizes they're not. In explaining that he now gets it, the president arrived at what may have been one of the stranger metaphors he's used in some time, invoking the first lady and household chores.",
    "It was a jarring version of Ronald Reagan's \"trust but verify\" and a comparison unlikely to come out of the presidential cupboard again. But the point was made.<strong> </strong>",
    "Sen. Mitch McConnell undoubtedly had no illusions that he would be the ideal candidate of Tea Party conservatives.",
    "Still, the Republican leader in the Senate couldn't have expected what sounds like disdain from his own campaign manager.",
    "\"Between you and me, I'm sorta holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand (Paul) in '16. So that's my long vision,\" Jesse Benton, the campaign manager, said during a phone call, secretly recorded early this year by a conservative activist, and recently published by <a href=\"http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/08/mitch-mcconnell-campaign-manager-im.html\" target=\"_blank\">Economic Policy Journal</a>.",
    "Benton, a libertarian, has been a top campaign aide to both Ron Paul, the former congressman from Texas, and his son, the junior senator from Kentucky, who is talked of as a possible presidential candidate. Benton is also married to a granddaughter of the elder Paul.",
    "Benton, hired by McConnell 11 months ago, was supposed to be the Senate minority leader's emissary to Tea Party conservatives, especially now that he tries to get past a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin.",
    "Benton's words could prove damaging to McConnell if it gives enough Kentucky conservatives one more reason to vote against the four-term incumbent. And Benton tried to clean up the political mess in a statement released by the McConnell campaign:",
    "All in all, it's not easy being McConnell right about now. He is viewed by many conservatives, including evidently his campaign manager, as an establishment Republican too ready to make deals with Democrats.",
    "If it's too much for him to both grin and bear the diss by Benton, he at least has to bear it. Firing Benton would inflame exactly the voters McConnell was hoping Benton could soothe. So that doesn't appear to be an option.",
    "He also has a feisty Republican primary foe who could require McConnell to burn through a lot of his $10 million war chest and, if the senator succeeds, soften him up for the Democrat.",
    "And that Democrat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, recently showed that she can deliver a devastating attack line when she said McConnell couldn't even \"pass a kidney stone.\" But more painful than that for McConnell might be a <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/08/01/poll-kentuckys-mitch-mcconnell-trails-in-senate-re-election-bid\">recent poll</a> — albeit by a Democratic pollster – that found Grimes and McConnell essentially tied.",
    "Still, it's early and McConnell is an experienced political infighter. While <em><a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/story/6045\" target=\"_blank\">The Cook Political Report</a></em> has moved the race to toss-up status, <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/ratings-changes-and-non-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Larry <em>Sabato's Crystal Ball</em></a> still favors McConnell to win the race.",
    "Lee Daniels has directed critically acclaimed films that deal with difficult subject matter before, but he says working on <em>The Butler</em> was \"the hardest thing he's ever done.\"",
    "The film chronicles the life of a man who rose from the cotton fields of North Carolina to work in the White House, witnessing some of the most important moments in this nation's history.",
    "The movie's main character, Cecil Gaines, is loosely based on the life of Eugene Allen, who worked at the White House for over three decades. Allen and his wife, Helene, were profiled by <em>Washington Post</em> writer Wil Haygood during the 2008 presidential election.",
    "Daniels and Haygood sat down with <em>Tell Me More</em> host Michel Martin to talk about <em>The Butler,</em> and the man who inspired it all.",
    "<strong>On the search for a witness<br></strong>",
    "In the midst of the 2008 presidential campaign, journalist Wil Haygood had a feeling that Barack Obama was going to win. And he wanted to profile someone who had witnessed the civil rights movement from the 1960s to the present time.",
    "\"I just knew it was going to exhaust the hell out of me,\" Haygood says. \"I was just looking for anybody — a butler, a maid, somebody who washed the windows.\"",
    "Haygood made call after call, searching for someone who would fit the bill. Eventually he struck gold with Eugene Allen. \"I was under the impression he had worked for three presidents. He corrected me, and he said it was eight.\"",
    "<strong>On the story's relationship with the civil rights era</strong>",
    "Although it delves into the civil rights movement, Daniels says that wasn't his initial intention. \"This story is really a love affair for me. A father-son love affair that transcended race. It wasn't until we started shooting some of the atrocities that happened in the South that I realized that this was on another level.",
    "Daniels described one scene in particular that stood out for him. \"We were shooting the bus scene; there were freedom riders on the bus. It was hot, it was a real bus, and I'm in the center of the bus with these kids on a bridge where black men were lynched.\"",
    "Daniels says that after yelling 'action,' actors playing the role of KKK members stormed the bus carrying burning crosses and yelling insults.",
    "\"I'm a little scared, and I think so were the actors on the bus, and I yell to the window 'cut.' But they can't hear me,\" says Daniels. \"And I realize — when it happened — there was no one to yell cut for these children, and that these kids were really fighting for the soul of our country, and that they were heroes in a way that I could never be. ... That's when I realized it was a bigger movie than just a father-son story. It's not a movie — it's a movement.\"",

    "Daniels says that when he makes a movie he goes into a cocoon and often disconnects from the outside world and news of the day to focus on painting an accurate historical picture. But he noted that the film's conversations about race are still relevant today. \"I come out, and Trayvon Martin is happening. It's out of body. It leaves me speechless. I'm at a sense of loss, because I did the movie, we end on hope. Cecil walking down, and Obama's speaking, and this glorious music, and those iconic words from those presidents are inundating us, and you know where are we?\"",

    "\"To me, it's almost biblical. The last shall be first. The movie is about the butler. He's up in heaven. He can tell President Eisenhower, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Ford, Nixon, Reagan. He can tell them, 'Hey, we're having a movie in the theater of heaven tonight. It's called<em> Lee Daniels' The Butler</em>, and it's really not about any eight of you, it's about the guy who used to serve you the popcorn at the White House theater. It's about me. Have a seat.'

    "People have been talking a lot lately about the National Security Agency. But there's another important \"NSA\" in the federal government — the president's national security adviser.",
    "That person is a sort of funnel — gathering information from the military, the intelligence community, the State Department — and channeling it all to the president.",
    "Susan Rice has been in the job for only a month — but it's been one heck of a month. The day Rice started her new job, Egypt's military overthrew the Egyptian government. Then, the controversy surrounding leaker Edward Snowden blew up. And last week, with both of those fires still raging, another crisis pulled Rice and the national security team into the White House Situation Room: a terrorist threat that led to the closing of U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and North Africa.",
    "This latest threat has deep personal significance for the new national security adviser. Fifteen years ago this week, Rice was the State Department's undersecretary for African affairs when terrorists blew up two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded.",
    "Prudence Bushnell, who was the American ambassador to Kenya at the time, says the attack had \"a huge impact\" on Rice.",
    "\"I know it did because she came to visit a few months afterward,\" Bushnell says. \"You couldn't have been in the Department of State without having been impacted — and certainly not in African affairs.\"",
    "Last year, Rice was ambassador to the United Nations when terrorists struck again — this time in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed.",
    "Following that attack, Rice used talking points that were wrong on Sunday morning news shows. That mistake may have kept her from being nominated for secretary of state.",
    "\"Susan Rice should have known better,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said on Fox News, \"and if she didn't know better, she's not qualified.\"",
    "Rice did not need Senate confirmation to be President Obama's national security adviser.",
    "Those crucible experiences shape the person Rice is today. She painfully learned the cost of not doing enough.",
    "Ben Rhodes works closely with Rice as deputy national security adviser at the White House, where, he says, \"there's definitely a lean toward action because there's an understanding that there's really no margin for error.\"",
    "\"Action\" is a word that comes up a lot when people talk about Rice.",
    "Her predecessor, Tom Donilon, was extremely low-key. Nobody would describe Rice that way.",
    "Instead, people call her style \"energetic,\" \"no-nonsense\" or \"rigorous.\" At the White House, her meetings start and end on time.",
    "Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution has known Rice for 20 years.",
    "\"If someone from an agency is giving her an inadequate answer or giving her the runaround, Susan's going to cut to the chase and say, 'Look, this is what I need to know,' \" he says.",
    "Tommy Vietor, who was a White House national security spokesman during Obama's first term, says Rice gets \"into the weeds.\"",
    "\"She knows the details. She is tough and smart and will get your attention if you're slipping,\" Vietor says.",
    "When Rice arrived at the White House a month ago, she made a point to meet each person who works on the National Security Council, Rhodes says.",
    "\"And she's gone out of her way to make people know that their work is going to reach the president, and their voice is going to reach the president,\" he says.",
    "That's one reason national security adviser is such a powerful job: She hears from everyone with a stake in the argument, but the president may hear only from her.",
    "Vietor describes how a typical decision might play out — say, to close embassies around the world.",
    "\"The national security adviser is convening the broader national security apparatus and saying: FBI, CIA, State, Defense, come to the table and let's discuss this. Let's figure out all the implications of these decisions and then let's vote,\" he explains.",
    "And, he says, they do literally take a vote. \"The president gets a number of decisions every day that are unanimous, and he gets many others that are divided.\"",
    "Some national security advisers weigh in at stakeholder meetings, while others hold their counsel for the president. People in these meetings say, not surprisingly, that Rice expresses a strong view.",
    "During this harried month, folks at the White House say they have more than once heard the president joke with Rice about whether she's sure she wants the job.",
    "It's not too late to back out, he tells her. She always replies: Happy to be here.",

    "As the supply chain that delivers our food to us gets longer and more complicated, many consumers want to understand — and control — where their food comes from.",
    "But even if we meet farmers at the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/30/160303008/on-the-farmers-market-frontier-its-not-just-about-profit\">farmers market</a>, urban consumers are still largely divorced from the people who grow, pick and package our food. And we may even willfully ignore their suffering, argues <a href=\"http://sph.berkeley.edu/faculty/holmes.php\">Seth Holmes</a>, a medical anthropologist and professor of health and social behavior at the University of California, Berkeley, in his provocative new book, <a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520275140\">Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies</a>.",
    "For two summers between 2003 and 2005, Holmes lived on a farm in the Skagit Valley of Washington state. The farm produces strawberries, apples, raspberries and blueberries to sell to berry companies like Driscoll and dairy companies like Häagen-Dazs. He traveled there with a group of Triqui Indians, across the border from their hometown of San Miguel in Oaxaca, Mexico. As Holmes soon learned, the Triquis make up the very bottom rung of the agricultural labor ladder and earn between $5,000 to $8,000 a year.",
    "Holmes stayed in the camp with the other laborers, in a shack with a tin roof and no insulation. Over the winter, he traveled with the Triquis to Madera, Calif., to prune grapevines in a vineyard. In 2005, Holmes went back to medical school, but he has continued to visit the same workers nearly every year since.",
    "On the berry farm, Holmes picked fruit once or twice a week; the Triqui workers picked seven days a week, rain or shine, without a day off. And that took a heavy toll on their bodies: back and knee pain, slipped disks, Type 2 diabetes, premature births. As one Triqui worker he calls Abelino told him, \"You pick with your hands bent over kneeling, your back hurts; you get knee pains and [hip] pains ... You suffer a lot.\"",
    "We talked to Holmes about his time with the Triquis; here's part of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.",
    "<strong>What was the most surprising or shocking aspect of the food system that you uncovered in your research?</strong>",
    "\"Before I did the research, I had a sense of the hierarchy of people involved in the food labor chain. But over the course of the first five months, it became clear that the hierarchy is much more detailed and subtle. There are indigenous Mexicans [like the Triqui] who occupy the rung with the most demanding physical labor — they're the ones who are bent over picking. The <em>mestizos</em> operate the machines — that's not quite as demanding. Then the U.S.-born Latinos are in charge of some things, and use English and Spanish. The white Americans have the most control.",
    "\"What was troubling was that people on every rung of hierarchy are legitimizing and justifying it. Farmworkers are doing that, too.\"",
    "<strong>Do you think that hierarchy is representative of farms in other states in the U.S.?</strong>",
    "\"I think it is. The indigenous people from Mexico and Central America have the least powerful position. The system is different in California, because farms tend to hire <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865345\">a contractor</a> to get big fields picked or pruned. The contractor goes out and finds laborers, and in my field research, I found that system to be worse in the sense that farmworkers are not paid directly by the farm. There's no paper trail. When we were in California, every time we pruned, we were paid less than minimum wage. With that system, labor laws are less likely to be enforced. But in Washington state, the farmworkers were hired directly by farmers, who were more likely to pay minimum wage.\"",
    "<strong>Do you think that the American public cares about the labor required to produce our food?</strong>",
    "\"We talk so little about the people who do the work that gives us the fresh fruit and vegetables that we want. Farmworkers are pretty hidden, and there's a concept from Jean-Paul Sartre, the French philosopher, called <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/\">bad faith</a>, meaning self-deception. My simplified version of that is that we consciously hide from ourselves the difficult realities of the workers. We somewhat know them, but we don't think about them much. In that way it seems like 'communal bad faith.' \"",
    "<strong>Why do you think the people in the food movement calling for changes in the industrial food system don't talk <strong>much</strong> about the labor issues?</strong>",
    "\"On some level, a lot of the food movement is concerned with: How does this food affect me and my body? Are there hormones in it? <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/07/11/200870193/are-antibiotics-on-the-farm-risky-business\">Antibiotics</a>? Pesticides? But the workers who are harvesting the food and spraying the pesticides — their bodies are human, too. Ideally, we would think about them and what's going into that work. If there are ways that we, as consumers, can lend a voice towards farmworkers having health care that will protect the bodies that are working so hard to give us the healthy food we can eat, I think that's really important.\"",
    "<strong>So you think the health care available to farmworkers is deficient?</strong>",
    "\"In Washington state and California, the people I met were pretty lucky to have independently run, grant-funded, nonprofit clinics to go to. But it's unclear what will happen with the Affordable Care Act. The law is wonderful in lots of ways, and will increase access for a lot of people, but there are no provisions for immigrants. Meanwhile, immigration reform <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=203361077\">is stalled</a>, and it looks like part of the reason is that several representatives won't vote for reform unless newly legalized immigrants will not be eligible for full health care. But the people who are getting sick to help us get a healthy diet deserve health care.\"",
    "<strong>It's clear from the book that you don't really blame the farm owners for the poor living and working conditions of berry pickers. As you write, \"The corporatization of U.S. agriculture and the growth of international free markets squeeze growers such that they cannot easily imagine increasing the pay of the pickers or improving the labor camps without bankrupting the farm ... many of the most powerful inputs into the suffering of farmworkers are structural, not willed by individuals.\"</strong>",
    "\"Sometimes it is fair for us to blame farm owners. But sometimes it isn't. We also have to look at the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other free trade agreements. In general, the problems in agriculture are long-standing.\"",
    "<strong>What do you think is the most important thing for consumers to know about the people behind their food?</strong>",
    "\"Farmworkers help us be healthy by harvesting fruits and vegetables, and they're helping the health of our economy by paying sales taxes and Social Security. But we are not prone to value their health or bodies or well-being. That seems disrespectful and unfair.\"",
    "When winemakers crush the juice from grapes, what's left is a goopy pile of seeds, stems and skins called pomace. Until several years ago, these remains were more than likely destined for the dump.",
    "\"The pomace pile was one of the largest problems that the wine industry had with sustainability,\" says Paul Novak, general manager for <a href=\"http://wholevine.com/home\">WholeVine Products</a>, a sister company to winemaker Kendall-Jackson in Northern California.",
    "Currently, some wineries compost the unwanted leftovers for their own use or to sell to gardeners. But now, scientists and entrepreneurs are finding new and often surprising uses for this former waste product.",
    "Some winemakers, for instance, are using pomace as the basis of grapeseed oil. Researchers are also exploring pomace's properties as a food preservative — studies have shown that compounds called polyphenols found in grapes and in pomace kill bacteria that can cause food to spoil. One Oregon State University professor, <a href=\"http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foodsci/faculty/yyz.htm\">Yanyun Zhao</a>, has even toyed with turning pomace into a biodegradable material to make flower pots.",
    "\"We're continuously looking for new options,\" says Zhao, who has spent several years studying pomace and its potential uses in and out of the kitchen.",
    "And right now, one of the most promising commercial uses of pomace is also one of the tastiest: It's being turned into a gluten-free flour substitute.",
    "WholeVine has partnered with a local miller to produce the flour, which comes in 16 different varieties based on the different wine grapes — such as chardonnay, Riesling and merlot — used to make it.",
    "The journey from vine to oven begins in September with the harvest. WholeVine collects pomace left from after grapes are pressed. The seeds and skins need to be separated, dried and milled. The process takes place within a two-month period: Workers must move quickly to get the pomace dried and stabilized before mold takes hold and the polyphenols in pomace — which have been linked to many health benefits — start to degrade.",
    "\"There's a lot of nutrition and goodness that we are currently letting the mold get to and throw away,\" Novak says. \"We think that nutrition should be put into the system for humans.\"",
    "WholeVine says its products are also high in iron, fiber, protein and other nutrients. That's all well and good, but in order for the flour to have commercial success, it has to taste good, too.",
    "There's good news on that end, says Oregon State's Zhao. Her testing has found that grape pomace flour can replace as much as 20 percent of regular flour in baked goods like bread, brownies and muffins without altering the taste or texture. Add more than that, though, and you can start to change the flavor of food (pomace flour can be bitter in large quantities).",
    "Can consumers taste the difference? At Washington State University, food science undergraduate Gena McKahan tested out reactions to granola bars made with anywhere from 0 to 15 percent grape pomace flour. Participants in a blind taste test, McKahan says, preferred the bars with 5 percent or less grape flour. Even that small amount of pomace flour, McKahan says, can add a significant amount of polyphenols to a sweet treat.<strong></strong>",
    "Rachel Klemek, a baker in Orange County, Calif., admits she was skeptical when, four years ago, a friend suggested she experiment with a purple powder in the kitchen. \"If it's not butter, sugar, flour or eggs, I don't want it,\" says Klemek.",

These days, you'll fine Klemek selling several flavors of cabernet brownies and violet-colored pasta at <a href=\"http://www.blackmarketbakery.com/\">Blackmarket Bakery</a>, the shop she runs in Costa Mesa, Calif.",
    "The taste is slightly \"grape-y,\" she says. It retains the tannin quality of a cabernet sauvignon, the dryness associated with some red wines.<strong> </strong>I sampled several of her creations and can testify to their tastiness.",
    "Right now, only a fraction of the pomace produced nationally is meeting such a sweet afterlife. WholeVine's Novak says the goal is to create a market for its pomace-based products that will eventually allow the company to scale up operations.",

    "A <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12022/full\">new study</a> by University of Texas sociologist <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/prc/directory/faculty/cr653\">Catherine Riegle-Crumb</a> in the journal <em>Social Science Quarterly</em> offers an interesting new perspective on this divide. Along with co-author Chelsea Moore, Riegle-Crumb decided to dive into the gender divide in high school physics courses. (Even as the gender divide in some areas of science has diminished, a stubborn gap has persisted for decades in high school physics.)",
    "Riegle-Crumb had a simple question: The national divide showed boys were more likely to take physics than girls. But was this divide constant across the country?",
    "In an analysis of some 10,000 students at nearly 100 schools, Riegle-Crumb found that the divide was anything but constant.",
    "\"What we find is that there are many schools where boys and girls take high school physics at the same rate,\" Riegle-Crumb said in an interview. \"And that there are many other schools where more girls actually take physics than boys. And so when you look at the aggregate, you see a pattern where boys are taking physics more than girls, but there is a lot of variation around that.\"",
    "There are some obvious things that could cause those variations. If parents of some kids are scientists, or highly educated, they might push their daughters to take tough courses in high school. Wealthy families might be able to afford tutoring, or have one parent stay home to help kids with homework. Better funded suburban schools might be at an advantage over inner-city schools.",
    "But when Riegle-Crumb controlled for those and other possibilities, she found one reason remained: \"What we found is that in communities that had a higher percentage of women in the labor force who are working in science, technology, engineering and math, that in those schools, girls were as likely as boys to take physics, or even more likely.\"",
    "Riegle-Crumb's finding about the importance of local role models meshes with a broad range of <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_hidden_brain/2011/03/psychout_sexism.html\">earlier work</a> that shows the decision to pursue math and science is not about innate differences between boys and girls, but about <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5880/1164.summary\">social context</a> and norms. Countries with greater <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801.abstract\">gender equality</a>, for example, reveal more equal math test scores among boys and girls.",
    "Teenage girls growing up in communities where women are better represented in tech are more likely to see women commenting on tech issues in public forums and in school discussions — and more likely to run into a friend's astrophysicist mom at a birthday party.",
    "By contrast, Riegle-Crumb said, girls growing up in communities where most working women are in jobs traditionally held by women such as child care or nursing might not see the possibilities that exist.",
    "\"If I am a young woman growing up in a community or culture like that, then that's what I see as, 'Well, this is what I am expected to do,' \" Riegle-Crumb said. \"And so it may not ever occur to me, that, 'Oh, you know, I don't actually have to do that. There's a vast array of things I could choose to do.' But if no one around me is doing those things, it's hard for me to even consider that possibility.\"",
    "About five years ago, emergency room doctor Julie Brown met an 8-year-old girl who complained about a weeklong stomach ache. The girl was tight-lipped about what might be causing the pain, and she ended up visiting the Seattle Children's Hospital, where Brown works, twice. And then a third time.",

    "Then, the young girl's doctors ordered an X-ray, and found something odd. \"She had a stack of magnets and batteries in her stomach,\" Brown says. \"She went right to the operating room, where they did an endoscopy. They only found a couple of them.\"",
    "The doctors realized they would have to open her up and look for the rest. What they found was a minefield of tiny, round rare-earth magnets she had swallowed.",
    "A battery and a magnet were stuck together in her stomach, which caused an ulcer. A little further down the line in her gastrointestinal tract was another ulcer. The 8-year-old ended up losing about 10 centimeters of her intestines that had become seriously damaged.",
    "\"We actually do pretty well with less intestine, generally speaking,\" Brown says. \"But anyone who has had surgery involving opening the bowel has an increased lifelong risk of bowel obstruction due to <a href=\"http://www.emedicinehealth.com/adhesions_general_and_after_surgery/article_em.htm\">adhesions</a>.

    "The participants in this study were all bitten by five mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> three weeks after getting the vaccine shot.",
    "Because everyone got exposed at the same time, this study wasn't designed to show how PfSPZ works over time. For any vaccine to be successful in the field, it would need to ward off the disease for years after the inoculation. Three weeks would be way too short.",
    "Previous experimental vaccines have shown some effectiveness against the malaria parasite, but none have provided high levels of protection against the disease.

Since 1980, we've sent Egypt 221 fighter jets, valued at $8 billion. \"Our American military advisers in Cairo have for many years been advising against further acquisitions of F-16s,\" Springborg said. Egypt already has more F-16s than it needs, he said.",
    "I asked the State Department why the U.S. is giving Egypt weapons against the advice of its own military personnel. (The State Department, along with Congress, gives final approval on the weapons we send to Egypt.) Regarding those unused tanks, an official told me via email, it's not usual for a country to \"maintain a portion of its equipment in reserve in the event of security contingencies.\" The U.S. decides which weapons to send to countries like Egypt \"in consultation with our partners' own determination of their strategic and force structure requirements,\" the email added.",

    "While it might be worth waiting for the films to actually be made before declaring that they would benefit Clinton, criticism could influence the filmmakers to err on the side of more negativity. So it could be a smart move all the way around for Priebus.",
    "Both movies reportedly would air next year, well before the 2016 presidential race. Timing is important because of the federal equal-time rule, which requires that if a broadcast or cable outlet shows a documentary featuring a legally qualified candidate once the campaign for an office is officially underway, it must give equal time to other candidates for that office.",
    "And regardless of timing, the fictional mini-series, unlike the documentary, wouldn't trigger the equal-time law unless the real Clinton popped up somewhere in it, like in a cameo, according to an FCC official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.",
